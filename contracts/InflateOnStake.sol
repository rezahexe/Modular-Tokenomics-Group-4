What is staking? What is inflation?

Inflation (in tokenomics) is the increase of the token's supply via minting.

Staking is when tokens are deposited into a contract for a determined amount of time, afterwards a reward is issued to the staker.

Why stake?
 - Governance: 
 - Liquidity:
 - Incentivize utilisation of currency
 - Encourage long-term holding

How would this contract be used?
As it stands, its just "deposit and mint new tokens" with no clear purpose of the token.
You should allow this functionality to be utilised in other parts of the contract.

For example, require that a user has staked tokens, and if they have, they have voting
rights for some other part of the protocol based on their stake.

What if the protocol implementing the staking contract wants to utilize the staked tokens?

e.g.
inflateOnStake.getBalanceOf(address(this))
inflateOnStake.getLastUpdated(address(this))
